Here is the comprehensive updated plan for executing the task:

**Updated Plan:**
1. **Backend Updates (Node.js and Express)**:
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
   - Implement user authentication for HOD and faculty (using packages like Passport.js or JWT).
   - Create a `Task` model using Mongoose for MongoDB with attributes for credits, status, and assignment to faculty.
   - Develop API endpoints for:
     - Assigning tasks (POST)
     - Fetching tasks (GET)
     - Sending notifications (could be a simple email or in-app notification)
     - Generating and downloading reports (GET)
     - Fetching real-time stats (GET)

2. **Frontend Updates (React)**:
   - Use modern libraries for UI and animations:
     - Implement **Material-UI** or **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design.
     - Use **React Spring** or **Framer Motion** for seamless transitions and animations.
   - Create a new component for the HOD portal with:
     - A form to assign tasks.
     - A section to view real-time stats and download reports.
   - Create a new component for the faculty portal with:
     - A section to view assigned tasks and their statuses.
     - A section to view personal reports.
   - Implement routing to navigate between HOD and faculty portals using React Router.
   - Ensure users are redirected to their respective web pages only after logging in.
   - Use state management (like React Context or Redux) to manage user sessions and task data.
   - Add a visually appealing opening animation using animation libraries.
   - Design a custom loading symbol that aligns with the overall theme of the application.
   - Implement a toggle button represented by a sun and moon icon for transitioning between dark mode and light mode.
   - Ensure that the styles for both modes are visually appealing, with appropriate background colors and text colors.

3. **Styling**:
   - Ensure the design is modern and visually appealing, following the latest trends.
   - Ensure responsiveness and user-friendly design.

**Dependent Files to be edited:**
- New files for the Node.js backend (to be created).
- React components for HOD and faculty portals (to be created in `frontend/src/`).

**Followup Steps:**
- Install necessary packages (e.g., Express, Mongoose, Passport.js, Material-UI, React Spring, etc. for the backend and frontend).
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as intended.
- Deploy the application to a suitable platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).
